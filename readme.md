Here is a quick demonstration of what I worked on. So whats happening in the video? 
1. I'm runing my jupyter notebook with [Voila](https://blog.jupyter.org/and-voil√†-f6a2c08a4a93)
2. Then I'm selecting the area to do automated MNDWI analysis. By comparing each year to one and other the program prints out possible land loss (erosion).
3. Following this analysis, the program can display the yearly land loss graph 
4. Finally, the program assess how much the individual seagrass community are under risk as a result of coastal erosion (land loss).
	- Considering that the height of seagrass species plays an important role in their survival following turbidity and burial (Hemminga and Duarte, 2000), the level of vulnerability (V) of each seagrass meadow (i) was based on two factors; seagrass species height (H) and their distance to the nearest possible erosion place (D) using the following equation:
					  V~i,y~=H~i~xD~i,y~
Here you can see the video.
